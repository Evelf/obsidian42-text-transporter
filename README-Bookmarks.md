# Bookmarks
* Bookmkarks are shortcuts to files in your vault. You can have multiple bookmarks defined in settings.
* Bookmark is made up of the following parameters on one line:
  + File Name seperated by semicolon ; then the command
  + Command can be one of the following:
    + TOP - for top of the file
    + BOTTOM - for the bottom of the file
    + the text on a line in your target file. If you provide this as the location, all transporter oeprations will happen from the line after the location
+ Instead of file name, you can use DNPTODAY. This will then use today's Daily Note Page as the bookmark page. The commands form above are supported
